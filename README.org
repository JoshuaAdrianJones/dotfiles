** Usage

Add the contents of the vimprofile, emacs or zshprofiles to your respective .zshrc and .vimrc files if anything looks useful.

**  2022 updates

- Mostly using MacBookPro 2021 M1
- Mostly editing in VsCode and Emacs
- Terminal is iterm2 + Zsh + OhMyZsh
- Emacs set up is Spacemacs

Theme is: Nord-Theme everywhere since I find consistency is helpful and it's a nice muted dark-mode without black-on-white contrast.

** 2024 updates

- Still using MBP21-M1
- Still using VsCode, only really using emacs for org-mode
- Terminal is the same
- No longer using Spacemacs
- Theme is still nordtheme.
- I don't really use vim ever, but I do use evil mode in emacs.
